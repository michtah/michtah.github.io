        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am Michael. I am studying as a first year student here at the University of York. I'm mainly interested in computation for mathematics and simulations. I like writing code that can help us understand more about our reality. Other than that, writing various tools for mathematics is another thing I like to do.

            <h3>River Simulation Tool</h3>
            <p>
                This tool uses the <em>pillow</em> image library of Python to take in an image, and calculate possible river paths from it using a modified hill-climbing method.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tech: </strong>Python, Pillow
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenges:</strong> tuning the river flow, the speed of the algorithm, accuracy.

            <h3>Table Functions</h3>
            <p>
                This Python library provides functions to filter a table made with a list of dictionaries. It includes sorting, aggregation and filtering tools.

            <h3>Week 2 - Redesigning my Portfolio</h3>
            <p class="diary-para">
                This week, I rewrote my portfolio page from scratch. This was an interesting challenge as I have learned a lot of CSS between my previous attempt and this current attempt. I learned how to style pages, how to use the <code>rem</code> scaling, how to set background colors, and how to set the different states of links and buttons. I also learned how to make these cool floating sections, though this is not in the curriculum, I just thought they looked cool.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-para">
                The big challenge was just getting things to look right. You have to set a lot of styling, even for such a small page, to get everything looking exactly how you want. It's quite difficult. Another thing was deciding how much detail to add in my profile. I don't want to add too much, as this is a public website, but I think this was a good middle ground.
            </p>
            <p class="diary-para">
                I'd like to eventually come back and restyle/rewrite some parts of the page, or maybe integrate a different font, or include some images. For now though, I'm quite happy with it.
