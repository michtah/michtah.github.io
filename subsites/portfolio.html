        <p><em>Computer Science</em> International Year One student at the University of York.</p>
        <p>
            I am interested in scientific, performant computation. I wish to write optimised code that can help us learn more about our world and our universe. I am interested in mathematics too.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a first-year computer science student learning the fundamentals of programming, web development, computer architecture, and databases. I am currently not looking for an internship, but I'd be happy to have one related to scientific computations.
        </p>

            Outside of my studies, I am a big fan of mathematics of any kind, I am an artist, and I like making music as well. I often use my coding knowledge to help me with my music making.

            <p>Made on: <time datetime="2026-10-2">February 10th 2026</time></p>
            <p>
                Hello there! This is the first entry in my production diary. I hope you enjoy this little diary of what I made this week, and what I learned.
            </p>
            <p>
                This week, I made this very website. It was an interesting experience. I added this portfolio as a link to my main page. I learned how to use the <code>header</code> and <code>nav</code> tools more effectively. It really taught me a lot. So far, my proudest achievement is the look of it. We haven't started learning CSS properly just yet, but I remember some things from when I was learning web development on my own in high school. I wanted to create a blog back then, so I took up web development and some CSS on the way. The hardest part was honestly organising the code itself. I really am not used to a language where you have to type in <em>everything</em> and you can't take off large indented chunks into another function. It's quite interesting. HTML organisation is hard. In terms of anything theoretical I learned, I think I'd say how webpages are organised and how their structure and presentation data is entirely separate. It's quite interesting. The same webpage with the same structure can be presented a billion different ways. I learned how to set an ID for each item in the webpage. Next week, I want to work on my other sub-site, and add an article to the large numbers blog.
            <p>
                On the other end, I also am trying to learn some assembly. Currently I'm learning NASM, as it appears to be the one we're focusing on in our classes. I've found a pretty good website to simulate running NASM. I don't know if I want to become proficient in assembly yet, however. We'll see.
