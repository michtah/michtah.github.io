        Welcome to the explosion hazard! This is my personal website for less serious stuff like articles about my interests and various test websites. Here's a little bit about me:
    </p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Michael. I am a student at York and I'm learning web development as we speak. This website is part of that, and so will the various sub-sites that I make. Here's some things I like:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Programming: I know how to code in Java, C, and APL.</li>
        <li>Mathematics: My favourite activity. I like abstract mathematics like set theory and abstract algebra.</li>
        <li>Art: I draw in my free time, and this is my favourite hobby.</li>
        <li>Music: I love techno music, especially on the harder side.</li>
        <li>Writing: I love writing short stories to share with my friends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Websites</h2>
    <p>Here's the websites that I'm working on.</p>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="subsites/large_numbers.html">Large Numbers</a>: a website about <em>large numbers</em> (shocking, I know) and how to get them.</li>
        </ul>
